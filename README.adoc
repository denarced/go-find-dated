= go-find-dated

Find files based on the date in filename. Go version of https://github.com/denarced/find-dated.

== Usage

See the aforementioned find-dated to get an idea on how to use. Behavior should
be identical except for error handling which hasn't been implemented in this Go
version.

== Motivation

This was written merely in order to see how much performance would improve if
find-dated was written with Go and parallelism was utilized to the extreme.
Performance did in fact improve significantly. The test involved a directory
with 2601 subdirectories and 67200 files. They were created with a script in
find-dated repository. The approximate durations:

* ~1.45s: Python based find-dated
* ~0.23s: this
* ~0.11s: `find directory/ -type f` (this is just to have a reference to a
really fast implementation, to have some kind of frame of reference)

The tests were performed with a desktop computer with

* Ubuntu 16.04.4 64bit
* i7-3770
* 16GB
* Samsung 850 EVO 500GB
* ext4 filesystem
